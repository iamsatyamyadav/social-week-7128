## Unique Name :- System for monitoring courses

#Domain Description: In an educational Institute, there are several courses running parallel every day. For every course, there are several batches at the same/different times. Every course has a session-wise/day-wise schedule. It will be difficult for the Faculty Head to know the status of every batch i.e what is the session taught each day in a batch. So the Automated Course Monitoring System will keep the records of all the courses, batches, faculties, and the day-wise update for every batch. It will also help the Faculty Head to maintain the course plan.
